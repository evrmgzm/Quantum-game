## Î£∞ How to Play

### The Goal

The objective is to find all **4 hidden particles** on the grid.

### Controls

-   **Left Click (Observe):** Click on an unobserved (gray) cell to spend **1 Energy** and reveal clues about its surroundings.
-   **Right Click (Mark):** Right-click on any cell to place or remove a marker (compass icon). This action **does not cost energy** and is used to track your guesses.

### Understanding the Clues

When you observe a cell, you will get one of two results:

1.  **A green dot:** Congratulations, you've found a particle!
2.  **A set of numbers:** This cell is empty, but it gives you vital clues:
    -   **Large Number:** The "Manhattan distance" (sum of horizontal and vertical steps) to the nearest particle.
    -   **Alignment:** The total number of other particles in the same row AND column.
    -   **Adjacency:** The total number of particles in the 8 immediately surrounding cells.

### Winning the Game

1.  Mark exactly 4 cells where you believe the particles are located.
2.  Once you have 4 cells marked, the **"Confirm Guess"** button will become active.
3.  Click it to submit your answer. If you are correct, you win! If not, you lose.
